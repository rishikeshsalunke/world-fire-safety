                I'm a Java Full Stack Developer and fresher with hands-on experience
                building web applications using Java, Spring Boot, JSP, Servlets,
                MySQL, React, and Tailwind CSS. My journey started with learning core
                programming concepts and gradually moved into full stack development.
              </p>

              <p>
                I enjoy creating responsive user interfaces and developing backend
                systems that work together smoothly. I have also worked on projects
                like CRUD applications and a live weather app, helping me understand
                real-world development workflows.
              </p>

              <p>
                I also have basic knowledge of Python and continuously improve my
                skills by practicing, building projects, and exploring new
                technologies to grow as a developer.
